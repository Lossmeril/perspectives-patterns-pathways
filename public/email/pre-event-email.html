<p>Dear Attendees,</p>

<p>
  The
  <strong>Perspectives, Patterns, and Pathways (PPP) Conference</strong> is just
  around the corner, taking place on <strong>April 1st, 2025</strong>, from

  share some final updates to help you prepare.

  Due to time constraints at our main venue, the day will begin in a different
  location:

  infrastructures and systems — expect a rich and interdisciplinary set of
  conversations.
